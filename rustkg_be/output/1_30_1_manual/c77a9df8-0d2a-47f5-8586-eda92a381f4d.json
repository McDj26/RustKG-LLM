The upper bound must only be None if the actual iterator length is larger than usize::MAX. In that case, the lower bound must be usize::MAX, resulting in a .size_hint of (usize::MAX, None).","The iterator must produce exactly the number of elements it reported or diverge before reaching the end.","Safety","This trait must only be implemented when the contract is upheld. Consumers of this trait must inspect .size_hintâ€™s upper bound."]}}
