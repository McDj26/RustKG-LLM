{"stability":{"stable since":"1.0.0"},"apiName":"std::debug_assert_eq","apiType":"macro","apiDocumentation":{"apiDescription":["Asserts that two expressions are equal to each other.","On panic, this macro will print the values of the expressions with their debug representations.","Unlike assert_eq!, debug_assert_eq! statements are only enabled in non optimized builds by default. An optimized build will omit all debug_assert_eq! statements unless -C debug-assertions is passed to the compiler. This makes debug_assert_eq! useful for checks that are too expensive to be present in a release build but may be helpful during development."],"examples":["let a = 3;\nlet b = 1 + 2;\ndebug_assert_eq!(a, b);"]}}
