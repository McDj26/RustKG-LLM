{"stability":{"stable since":"1.0.0"},"apiName":"std::marker::Send","apiType":"trait","apiDocumentation":{"apiDescription":["Types that can be transferred across thread boundaries.","This trait is automatically implemented when the compiler determines it's appropriate.","An example of a non-Send type is the reference-counting pointer rc::Rc. If two threads attempt to clone Rcs that point to the same reference-counted value, they might try to update the reference count at the same time, which is undefined behavior because Rc doesn't use atomic operations. Its cousin sync::Arc does use atomic operations (incurring some overhead) and thus is Send.","See the Nomicon for more details."]}}
