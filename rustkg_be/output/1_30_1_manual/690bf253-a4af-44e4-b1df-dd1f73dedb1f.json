An optimized build will omit all debug_assert_ne! statements unless -C debug-assertions is passed to the compiler. This makes debug_assert_ne! useful for checks that are too expensive to be present in a release build but may be helpful during development."],"examples":["let a = 3;\nlet b = 2;\ndebug_assert_ne!(a, b);"]}}
