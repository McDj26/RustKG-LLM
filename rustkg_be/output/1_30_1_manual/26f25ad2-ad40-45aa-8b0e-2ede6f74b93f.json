{"stability":{"stable since":"1.0.0"},"apiName":"std::fs::rename","apiType":"function","apiDocumentation":{"apiDescription":["Rename a file or directory to a new name, replacing the original file if to already exists.","This will not work if the new name is on a different mount point.","Platform-specific behavior","This function currently corresponds to the rename function on Unix and the MoveFileEx function with the MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING flag on Windows.","Because of this, the behavior when both from and to exist differs. On Unix, if from is a directory, to must also be an (empty) directory. If from is not a directory, to must also be not a directory. In contrast, on Windows, from can be anything, but to must not be a directory.","Note that, this may change in the future.","Errors","This function will return an error in the following situations, but is not limited to just these cases:","from does not exist. The user lacks permissions to view contents. from and to are on separate filesystems."],"examples":["use std::fs;\n\nfn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    fs::rename(\"a.txt\", \"b.txt\")?; // Rename a.txt to b.txt\n    Ok(())\n}"]}}
