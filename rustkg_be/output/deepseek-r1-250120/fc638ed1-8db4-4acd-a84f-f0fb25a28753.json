One reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as data for zero-length slices using NonNull::dangling()."],["from_raw_parts","has caveat","The lifetime for the returned slice is inferred from its usage.
